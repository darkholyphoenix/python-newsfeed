## Title
  Python-Newsfeed

## Description
This is an app to build a basic newsfeed social media app. I have done a previous version before using Node.js, and this app was used entirely using Python instead. This app allows ones to create comments and posts, vote on the comments, and even comment on the posts. This app uses sqlalchemy, jinja, pymysql, dotenv, bycrypt as well as others.

Make sure that you install:
 PIP INSTALL FLASK
 PIP INSTALL sqlalchemy pymysql python-dotenv

 Once those are installed, simply run "python -m flask run" to run the website with the sql backend.

 Then go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser to start using it.
